# Plate-Detection-
I tried my best
PS.
Mainly the the file at last named as video_detection_code_only.ipynb works in a satisfactory manner plus its code is small and understandable

In all other files .ipynb code was taken from net to check what all methods can be used like image processing , firebase ml toolkit etc etc
